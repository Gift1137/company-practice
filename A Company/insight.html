The Chief Executive Officer of Optimum Petroleum Development Ltd, Engr. Yusuf K. J.

De-risking of our OGO field and other structures on our asset through appraisal and exploration drilling remains the clearest path of unlocking the said value of our asset.

The capital that we have allocated to Optimum Petroleum will enable them to become a formidable player in the Oil & Gas industry. This transaction will be the first Oil & Gas investment for Milost in Africa, and we are glad to be in partnership with such a dynamic company with seasoned management â€™s
</p>
<p>
Managing Partner & CEO of Milost Global Inc., Mr. Mandla J. Gwadiso, added, â€œThis is our first Oil & Gas transaction in Nigeria, optimum has a very solid portfolio of assets and that is what attracted us to the company. The fact that the management of the company is also industry veterans that have not only dedicated their lives in Optimum, but also invested heavily in the companyâ€™s development. For any value investor, it is a turn on to find a management that has skin in the game. We truly look forward to a very fruitful relationship with Yusuf and his team. â€™s
